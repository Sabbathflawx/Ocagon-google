```js
#!/usr/bin/env zx

await $`cat package.json | grep name`

let branch = await $`git branch --show-current`
await $`dep deploy --branch=${branch}`

await Promise.all([
  $`sleep 1; echo 1`,
  $`sleep 2; echo 2`,
  $`sleep 3; echo 3`,
])

let name = 'foo bar'
await $`mkdir /tmp/${name}`
```

Bash is great, but when it comes to writing more complex scripts,
many people prefer a more convenient programming language.
JavaScript is a perfect choice, but the Node.js standard library
requires additional hassle before using. The `zx` package provides
useful wrappers around `child_process`, escapes arguments and
gives sensible defaults.

## Install

```bash
npm install zx
```

Formatting and Readability: Organized imports and added consistent formatting to improve readability.
Error Handling: Maintained the existing error handling but ensured consistency in console output.
Functionality: Ensured the functionality remains unchanged while enhancing clarity.

Consistent Import Order: Group similar imports together.
Use of type for Type-Only Imports: Specify type for imports that are used only for types.
Consistent Naming Conventions: Ensure consistent use of camelCase for variables and functions.
Error Handling Enhancements: Enhance error messages and ensure they're more informative.
Simplify Logic and Improve Readability: Break down complex functions for better readability.
Reduce Redundant Code: Eliminate redundant logic where applicable.
TypeScript Features: Utilize TypeScript features for better type safety.

Changes and Improvements:
Consistency in Variable Declarations: Used const and let consistently and eliminated unnecessary semicolons.
String Handling: Simplified string handling by ensuring that contentStr is a string in one step.
Regex Patterns: Simplified regex patterns to make them more readable and efficient.
Early Returns: Employed early returns in simple conditions for readability.
Type Annotations: Ensured that functions and variables have clear type annotations.
Comments: Removed inline comments that are unnecessary given the clarity of the refactored code.

Explanation:
Direct assignment: Directly assigning values to globalThis properties improves clarity and reduces overhead.
Type declarations: Type declarations remain within the declare global block, simplifying type management.
Removed redundancy: By directly importing and assigning values, we eliminate repetitive use of typeof.
