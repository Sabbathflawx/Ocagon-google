```js
#!/usr/bin/env zx

await $`cat package.json | grep name`

let branch = await $`git branch --show-current`
await $`dep deploy --branch=${branch}`

await Promise.all([
  $`sleep 1; echo 1`,
  $`sleep 2; echo 2`,
  $`sleep 3; echo 3`,
])

let name = 'foo bar'
await $`mkdir /tmp/${name}`
```

Bash is great, but when it comes to writing more complex scripts,
many people prefer a more convenient programming language.
JavaScript is a perfect choice, but the Node.js standard library
requires additional hassle before using. The `zx` package provides
useful wrappers around `child_process`, escapes arguments and
gives sensible defaults.

## Install

```bash
npm install zx
```
